# Mango Classification using Machine Learning 🍋

This project classifies mango varieties using machine learning. It uses image data and notebook-based workflows for training, evaluation, and predictions. Ideal for building intelligent agricultural tools to detect and grade mangoes.

## 📦 Features
- Image-based mango classification
- Train/test pipeline in Jupyter Notebook
- Expandable for grading ripeness, size, defects

## 📁 Structure
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebook for model training
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies
- `.gitignore`: Ignores cache/log files

## 🚀 Run Instructions
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the notebook: `jupyter notebook notebooks/mango_classification.ipynb`

## 🧠 Technologies
- TensorFlow / PyTorch
- OpenCV, scikit-learn
- Roboflow dataset (optional)
